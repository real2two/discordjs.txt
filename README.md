***Discontinued / Rewriting the code***

# Welcome to discordjs.txt!
Check out our [wiki](https://github.com/real2two/discordjs.txt/wiki), which explains the Discord bot a bit!

# Setup
## These are few more steps that is not listed in the wiki.
You need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

After you installed that, you need to download the NPM [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/), using `npm install discordjs/discord.js` on the console.

Make sure to setup your bot in [settings.txt](https://github.com/real2two/discordjs.txt/blob/master/settings.json), which is explained in the [wiki](https://github.com/real2two/discordjs.txt/wiki#what-is-settingsjson). 

Finally to run the Discord bot, you need to run the command `node bot.js` in the command line.
